PROJECT CODENAME CALEDON WHITE
==============================
ProRaya is a software that functions as a little companion software for us during raya. This program is a 2-in-1 software.
The structures used in this program are the structure learn within our syllabus as well as extra structures that are not 
in the syllabus (mainly the file handling structures). The following are brief summary of what each menu option can do.
----------
Precaution
----------
To prevent any error in the program it is advised to leave the code and .exe program in its original file.
If any error were to occur with the duit raya giving list, such as runtime error and a continuous garbage 
value printing. Open the database file and delete the Data01.txt file and rerun the program.
----------
1.0 MONEY GIVING MANAGER
This menu is mainly for adults that are giving out duit raya. It contains 2 sub feature:

1.1 BUDGET ADVISOR
This feature here is designed to calculate the average  money distribution for a certain amount of kid (which we prompt the user).
This is best used when we are on a tight budget for raya and we want to be able to prepare raya envelope for our relatives.

1.2 DUIT RAYA GIVING LIST
This feature enables us to create a check list for whom we give the raya money to and how much. The data in this one kept within a txt 
file so if we were to close the program the data will still be there and it status can be update.
*There is no delete entry option or edit entry since the data can be directly edit in its txt file

2.0 CALORIES CALCULATOR
For all the people who are calories aware this feature lets you calculate your calorie intake with a preset of 76 Malaysian
raya cruisine. The tally value of the calories won't be save. So you can calculate various combo of dishes to see if you 
overeat or compare with a different combo.

3.0 MISC
Everytime when you run the program, it will prompt for your name. The name will be kept inside a log.txt with the time you enter your name.
